Skripts for **`Utility`**:

- [***MineMeeerPerks***](/Utility/MineMeeerPerks) by [`deutschich` ](https://github.com/deutschich):

> **MineMeeerMC Perks** is a Skript-based perk system that adds a clean and user-friendly GUI for managing player perks such as **Fly** and **Keep Inventory**. Players can toggle their perks on and off directly from the menu, and their active perks are automatically reapplied when they rejoin the server. Locked perks are clearly displayed and require the appropriate permission to use. 
> 
> The system also includes an **Oraxen voucher integration** with a confirmation GUI, allowing players to redeem perk vouchers that grant permanent permissions via **LuckPerms**. Admins can easily manage the system with commands to reload the script, check the version, and give perk vouchers to players.
